Exploring NGINX


NGINX
- It's a gateway between the internet and back-end infrastructure.
- It's used as a web server, reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache to handle the demands of high traffic sites.
- To find the server used in a web app, direct to Network in developer tools and head over to Response headers, you will find the server if the web app uses it.
